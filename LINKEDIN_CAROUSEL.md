## Slide 1 — Hook

**A small GIS task → a deep computational geometry challenge**

We tried to build a **true polygon offset**
that works for **both convex and concave shapes**.

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem

Standard buffer/offset tools often create:

* Self-intersections
* Wrong trimming
* Non-uniform distance

So we asked:

**Can we build the offset purely from mathematics?**

---

## Slide 3 — The Journey

This was not solved in one attempt.

We:

* Sketched ideas
* Tested multiple logics
* Faced failures
* Debated geometry
* Refined the math together

**Teamwork made the difference.**

---

## Slide 4 — Core Idea

Build offset using:

**Vector mathematics + computational geometry
instead of black-box GIS tools.**

---

## Slide 5 — Algorithm Overview

1. Ordered vertices
2. Unit normals
3. Parallel offset edges
4. Convex/concave detection
5. Intersection trimming
6. Polygon reconstruction

---

## Slide 6 — Result

✔ Accurate distance
✔ Clean topology
✔ Works for concave + convex

**True mathematical offset polygon achieved.**

---

## Slide 7 — Bigger Lesson

This wasn’t just coding.

It was:

**math + discussion + persistence + teamwork**

> Real engineering begins where tools fail.
