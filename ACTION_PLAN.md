# LinkedIn Post Action Plan

## 1. Prepare Your Assets

- [ ] **Code Cleanup**: Ensure `true_offset.py` is clean and commented (Done).
- [ ] **Visuals**: Create the carousel slides based on `LINKEDIN_CAROUSEL.md`. You can use tools like Canva or PowerPoint.
    - **Tip**: Use high-contrast colors (e.g., dark background with bright vector lines) to emphasize the "computational geometry" theme.
    - **Tip**: Include a screenshot or diagram of the polygon offset result in Slide 6.
- [ ] **Repository**: Push the code and README to a new GitHub repository named `true-polygon-offset`.

## 2. Crafting the Post

- [ ] **Copy the Text**: Use the "Improved Expert + Storytelling Version" text provided in the chat as your main post body.
- [ ] **Tagging**:
    - Tag your team members who helped (critical for the "teamwork" angle).
    - Tag relevant experts or mentors if appropriate.
- [ ] **Hashtags**: Use the suggested tags: `#GIS #Python #ComputationalGeometry #ArcGIS #Geometry #ProblemSolving #TeamWork`.
- [ ] **Link in Comments**: Post the GitHub link in the *first comment*, not the main post body (LinkedIn algorithm often penalizes posts with external links in the main text).

## 3. Posting Strategy

- [ ] **Timing**: Post on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning (between 8 AM - 10 AM local time) for best professional engagement.
- [ ] **Engagement**:
    - Respond to every comment within the first hour. This boosts the post's visibility.
    - If someone asks a technical question, give a detailed, thoughtful reply (showcase your expertise).

## 4. Follow-Up

- [ ] **Monitor Feedback**: Look for suggestions on handling edge cases (like holes in polygons) and add them to your "Future Work" list.
- [ ] **Connect**: Send connection requests to people who engage meaningfully with your post, with a note like "Thanks for the great comment on my GIS geometry post!"
